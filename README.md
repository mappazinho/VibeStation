# Introducing Grim Reaper

*Grim Reaper* is a built-in tool specifically made for **corruptions**.  Grim Reaper uses Random Strike to do all of its corruptions (essentially randomly hitting any byte).  
### Modes:  
**RAM Reaper**

<sup> You can call this cartridge tilting if you want

*RAM Reaper* does exactly what it says. It corrupts the memory of the PS1. It can corrupt the main memory, video memory, sound memory or all of them at once. It uses a random or custom seed for the corruption.  
RAM Reaper will hit any byte in your hex range randomly every frame.  
⚠️ Main RAM is very delicate and with high parameters it *will* hang the emulator, you will need to restart the BIOS.  
✅ VRAM and SPU RAM is safe to hit at any parameters if you want fun glitches.  


**Batch Corruption**

Essentially, it is "Vinesauce ROM Corruptor". It corrupts your selected BIOS and boots it up.

Intro/Bootmenu hits the sensitive areas of the BIOS (0x18000-0x63FFF). 0.01% is a safe parameter for a successful boot sequence.

Character Sets is a fun corruption that corrupts the characters of the BIOS. The corruption is visible at the PlayStation logo text.

End will usually not affect your BIOS, but it can prevent game loading.

## Build requirements
Atleast VS 2022 (tested with vs 2022, 2026)  
CMake 3.20+ (tested with CMake 4.2.2)  
Access to internet (to download dependencies)  

# Build
Run `cmake -S . -B build-vs -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64`  
and  
`cmake --build build-vs --config Release` (or compile inside Visual Studio)    
  
    
#### ⚠️ The program does ***not*** provide any kind of BIOS files and does not condone piracy. ***All*** BIOS files used must be legally obtained or extracted from your owned console.

### ⚠️ MANY THINGS ARE EXPERIMENTAL, NOT IMPLEMENTED AND/OR NOT WORKING!
